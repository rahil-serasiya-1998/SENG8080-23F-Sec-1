Have been using this for some days now , and it definitely helps u be more productive. The app looks so good and that makes u want to go back to it , and in the process tick off everything you've planned. Lot of options (of course for the premium version) . You have a lot of challenges and when u realise that a lot of other people are doing it, even u feel like doing them. All in all, very happy with the app.","54 people found this review helpful","","",""

However, unless sive done something wrong, it doesn't give you reminders (even when you set them up) about your challenges or tasks and you have to open the app to see them - this isn't very good if you're not great at keeping a habit or are forgetful. Additionally, if you don't open the app for a day it assumes you missed the challenge for that day, as opposed to asking if you did the challenge or not.","9 people found this review helpful","","",""

It helps me feel successful and slowly build up my health habits, like drinking water or exercise. Start small and grow from there. It does have some limitations.

Only complaint is that it's misleading to say the app is free, you don't have to pay to install it, but you do have to pay a subscription to get good use of it. The free trial version only allows a few habits and constantly pop ups to subscribe. Totally understandable from the developers, but I wouldn't advertise it as free.

Making things slightly more compact can go a long way to helping actually manage the day, and be more productive.

It was a pleasure to use, I can see a lot of effort were put into UX design of the app. Things I did not like. The ""trial or pay for a monthly sub"" screen, and trying it would put you to a yearly subscription. (half of the reviews are about this issue, so I don't need to explain that.) You have a person doing review damage control, saying ""you don't get charged after the trial"" or whatever. Sure. But my problem is, how is this issue still here? You have been hearing the complain as long as the app is in play store. Why is the ""trail or pay"" screen get an update to explain how the payment works better, so users don't feel tricked into a subscription. Paid only apps are great if that goes back to the app getting better over time.

That's an app that I actually do work on, for hours a day. At times I prefer that over Outlook on desktop. I would be happy to pay upwards $50/month. But it's only $15 ONE TIME FEE. Smart concept, because there is no free version. Use it? Pay. We all pay, and price gets low.","26 people found this review helpful","Apalon Apps","March 23, 2020","Thank you for the feedback. A subscription-based pricing model ensures that you get the most efficient and highly-functional apps for lower costs. We are sorry if the proposed subscription plans do not meet your needs. If you are not ready to get a paid version, you can continue using a free version of the app as long as you want."

I could justify a one-time purchase, but not a subscription. It is easy to set goals in the app, and the UI is very clean looking. However, it focuses too much on streaks, so it makes it easier for me to be less strict with myself and check something to continue the streak. Also doesn't do a great job in helping to set specific goals. Just too steep of a price for what it is and needs a couple of improvements.","71 people found this review helpful","Apalon Apps","February 16, 2021","Hi, Alex! Thanks for your opinion.

After 7 days, it will start a yearly(!) subscription. I thought okay. When I opened the app again, a button on the top was saying ""Try for Free"". No mention that I already have a subscription. When I click on Try for Free, it asks if I want to try it and then have a monthly subscription. Very sly and sneaky, instantly lost trust. Don't trust them.","84 people found this review helpful","Apalon Apps","March 23, 2020","The application does not initiate a payment unless you subscribe for Premium. If you had a free trial and haven’t cancelled it, the account should have been charged only after the end of the trial period and then automatically according to the duration of your subscription plan. You can always cancel it in Play Store - Subscriptions."

Very costly subscription. Well, you asked for suggestions. Some I've already mentioned, you can also make more persistent notifications with customizable sounds and periods, gesture customization, night&day mode, daily routines with timers for each habit, motivators, cool animations on completion, custom colors (rgb), schedule.","","Apalon Apps","November 4, 2019","Thanks for your feedback.

They do this so that u start paying as soon as it end probably without giving you any notice Edit: the developers have control over the app not some store. Still, obviously it makes sense to get convertions but it is very lousy to start taking money right after the free trial without a warning. Regarding the limited app its hidden in the UI i have to tap the 'x' twice to get there which is unintuitive. the limited app is ok","13 people found this review helpful","Apalon Apps","November 12, 2019","Your card details are requested by the store, not by the developer, and it only happens when you decide to use the Premium functions or activate the free trial period. You can reject the free trial offer and continue using the limited app version. For this simply tap the corresponding button on the offer screen."

It is helping me really get back to doing things. However, I do wish there was a feature where you could add something to it like a calendar. Because if you use the App as an assistant to your schedule it's crucial you can put appointments and events. I know it's to boost productivity, and it does, but it would be helpful if it could all be in one place.","73 people found this review helpful","","",""

I've only downloaded it today, and I already have most of my tasks done! This app has no bugs whatsoever, and I love the software. It's smooth, and it looks nice to me. There are so many reminders/habits that you can easily hand pick from the options given. Like sleeping, online studying, and so much more! As a student, this reminder app will definitely help me a lot with tracking tasks and more. The app has so much more to offer than you think, download it now! I love it!","76 people found this review helpful","Apalon Apps","August 4, 2021","Hi there, and thank you so much for reviewing our app!

I did have a negative experience when adding a goal. I thought a goal meant that there was an extra notification when I've managed to perform a habit successfully for a predefined streak of days, but it's actually a goal for times within a day. I set a goal of doing 100 pushups/day x 5 days, then realized it was a goal of doing 100x5/day, which I can't. I then tried to turn it off but it cannot turn off once set, so I think it's a bug.","21 people found this review helpful","Apalon Apps","March 12, 2020","Please contact our support team (support@apalon.com) so that we could assist you with a solution to the issue.

It is very good for people like me who need a little bit of external help to assist me in creating good habits. As a woman, all the cleaning tasks I have to remember are so overwhelming... more overwhelming than the cleaning itself. But this app is like an external hard drive freeing up space in my mind to make it have an extremely powerful performance. Would like the option of more colours and icons as I love my colours but otherwise 10/10!","21 people found this review helpful","Apalon Apps","May 19, 2020","Alisha, thank you for your positive review!
