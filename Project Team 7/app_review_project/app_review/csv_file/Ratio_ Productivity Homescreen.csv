The launcher with it's subscription model leaves a lot to be desired. The rate at which bugs are patched and previous features are polished is very slow. For example, the currency converter has not had USD in it for over month, though they added probably a hundred cryptocurrencies. I wish the team would prioritise getting the features they have polished and actually fix the usability of them.","15 people found this review helpful","","",""

So, I made a lifetime purchase of the app as well. The app is designed beautifully and also had compartmentalised sections very well. But to be honest after using it for 2 weeks I started feeling uneasy and kind of depressed as all i could see in my phone was minimal UI and no colors. I tried to change settings to add more colors but couldn't find any options. So finally I uninstall it.","48 people found this review helpful","Blloc","July 31, 2022","Hey Pratik!

There is no way to hide apps in a bunch, you'll have to do it one by one. Home screen ia pretty nice but app drawer is a complete mess. If i have added apps to my home screen they should not be present in my app drawer. It just created a mess. The app feels jittery and the animations are far from smooth.

First of all, there needs to be a time card or widget for the home screen and root. It is extremely weird to see the lack of one. Secondly, work profile apps need to be separated into a different tab/drawer/folder. Otherwise, the apps list becomes cluttered. Also add some options to manage the apps grid.

The whole monochromatic with just a single neon yellow color looks so good. The feature for putting a lock or hiding a particular app is great. I can tell that for some people this can replace the default launcher. But I am giving it a 4 because it's, still at development stage. What I mean is that this launcher does not feel complete. Lock-screen still remains the device default looks. Have to put a dark wallpaper to match the lock-screen with the main screen. The message app is still on development, so there is no reply option for any particular test. The message also takes over the default notification, which does not allow to reply directly from the notification. And there are some other bugs too. For now this launcher is attracts a crowd.","30 people found this review helpful","Blloc","March 2, 2021","Biswajit, thank you for your in depth review - they really make a difference for us.

Thumbs up for that. I would like to provide a feedback though. There are some apps i would like to access instantly. Like the dialer. I would like to pin them to the left most screen like a widget. I am not sure if that is a feature but even if it was, it was not entirely evident.","","Blloc","November 20, 2020","Hi Shubham, thanks a lot for your feedback! We'll soon be opening up an SDK program , and if you're interested you can sign up at blloc.com/developers Widgets are a highly requested feature, and we'll see what we can do about this from next year :)"

Good idea though Edit: 1. The wallpaper and themes wouldn't change even upon selecting the options. 2. The tree i.e. the message hub also stopped working. The same message would be repeated multiple times in a conversation. Upon reinstallation it started showing the code for each message within the {} brackets with the message in a content= marker.","","Blloc","January 15, 2021","Hey Saksham. The issue with messages displaying within {} is because you must have accidentally toggled a developer setting. In the 'For devs only' section, turn off 'DEBUG', and this should no longer happen. For the wallpaper, after selecting the wallpaper you want please select 'Apply Light/Dark wallpaper to system'. Let us know if this fixes it"

It helped me manage my usage and reduce it and helped me focus on other things without much of a distraction. A must have if you want a digital detox. Have been using for a few days now but I am satisfied with the outcome. The UI is clean and minimal and gives me only important information. No clutter or stupid apps popping up with push notifications is just a bliss.","3 people found this review helpful","Blloc","April 9, 2021","Hi Rhishabh, thank you so much for your review!

Great job devs👏. But one more thing: The app drawer seems to interfere with the navigation gestures. Whenever I try to open recent apps from ratio, the drawer seems to show up for a second. You could solve this by making the app drawer trigger only when swiped up from the dock. And you could make an INTEGRATION WITH KLWP. Like send a broadcast variable value when on home, another value for root, and another for conversation","14 people found this review helpful","Blloc","May 10, 2021","Rufus, many thanks for your feedback!

Really looking forward to it.","21 people found this review helpful","Blloc","December 1, 2020","Hey Arnold, thank you for the feedback! We're sorry the wallpapers are causing some issues for you, but we will be releasing a big update to how Ratio handles wallpapers soon. In the meantime try checking in your gallery if there's a folder called ""Ratio Wallpapers"", hopefully you'll be able to find them there."

It feels good but i don't know why it is crashing automatically again and again. User experience is still as amazing as it was before moreover it has improved a lot. But the default launcher appears everytime I use my phone after some time. Please help me out with the crash.","9 people found this review helpful","Blloc","March 29, 2021","Hi Nitin - thanks for your review! We will be soon releasing a patch that should help with the specific crashing!"

Integrate contacts and file searches into the search box. It will make our job more easy, quick and powerfull --powerfull search box will go long with minimalism 2. Include a toggle button to enable/disable swipe up app drawer. Since there are powerful features like home screen drawers and search box, an always enabled swipe up app drawer seems to be against the spirit of minimalism 3. Try to provide a rigid build. At times many features appear to break even after several reinstalls.","","Blloc","July 8, 2021","Vishakh, thanks for your feedback. 1. You're reading our mind. 2. We're currently working on optimizing the app drawer and UX with that. 3. We're be happy to have more information on that from you - if there's anything specific, please submit a bug report: www.blloc.com/bug-report"

How to fix this Devs? Thanks alot Devs! It is working now, the only suggestion that I have is that you can include playback of videos, and voicenotes in the tree itself, and also, the Instagram chats are not very stable, please look into that also. Otherwise, I am extremely satisfied with the look and performance! Looking forward to hearing from you soon!","19 people found this review helpful","Blloc","December 17, 2020","Hey, sorry to hear you experienced this issue. You need to enable Ratio as a notification listener in order for messages (from whatsapp/telegram/instagram/messenger lite) to show up in the Tree. You can go to Ratio Settings > Tree > start onboarding, and enable it in the Permissions. Let us know if this solves it!"
