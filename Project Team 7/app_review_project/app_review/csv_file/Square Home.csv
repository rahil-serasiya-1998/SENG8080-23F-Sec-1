Looks awesome, like nothing else. Initially it looks like windows tiles, but you can tweak it however you want, and make it look completely different. It's fully customisable! You can literally create your own interface & look. Comes with its own set of useful widgets. You can stack lots of widgets together in any way you want, and then lock everything at place! Also, effects and styles are cool! Just love it!","87 people found this review helpful","","",""
