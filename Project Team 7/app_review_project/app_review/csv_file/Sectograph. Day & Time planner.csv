Very intuitive, simply genius. However, the interaction with google Calendar needs a lot more work. Often, the app does not update when I add a new event or update an existing one. Even when I delete an event, from google calendar, it still shows up in sectograph. It is possible that I doing something wrong. But unless it is not so, please work on fixing these bugs. I wish you the best.","110 people found this review helpful",""

Love the fact that it visualizes my entire day based on my google calendar. Essential if you want to schedule your day or stick to a rhythm. Plus the fact that it gets data from google calendar means I don't have to duplicate my schedule. The visualization, widget & user interface is extremely well done. Have no qualms going for the pro edition to support the developer.","49 people found this review helpful",""

I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45Â° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.","4 people found this review helpful",""

This app saves lots of time and also we not have to worry about our remainders. The Widget feature is what I liked the most, its styles, interface is amazing. Another thing I liked is that we can edit the widget appearance. It automatically updates the remainders from the Google Calender itself, and we and also change the color from Google Calender.","4 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

It really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when I open to my home screen. My only complaint is that it does end up crowding my calendar app because it requires you to add an event to the calendar but past that, it's pretty great.

But the problem is that when there are more than one task at the same time, the texts superimpose on each othr and we can't read thm. Considering they use Google calender to set up the tasks, I feel like Google calender itself & its widget is more useful than this.

It really does help me visualize time until my next meeting and how much time I'm able to work outside of meetings. One possible improvement would be the ability to color all of the events coming from a certain calendar together in addition to being able to color them individually. Edit to add: there is already an option for this... awesome! So...maybe the ability to add some tap-able areas on the watch face?","10 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

I will admit I have used it in a while, but whenever I do I really enjoy this new way of seeing the time available to me and how it is filled.
