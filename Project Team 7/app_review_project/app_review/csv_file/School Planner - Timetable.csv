However there are sooo many advertisements!!! it's really annoying otherwise would have given 5 stars. Features I would recommend: 1.reduce the amount of ads 2.there is no selection of subject in tasks so I would recommend that (like it's in assignment). 3. Time selection. Task starts from and task finishes at That's all, I hope you add these features in future updates. Thank you. Good day","11 people found this review helpful","","","",""

So simple, easy to use, and it covers everything you need. I only have one problem. Could you please add another time option for subjects that has more than 1 day? In the app, we can already add more days, but no added time. We can only use 1 time for each day. Sometimes the subjects has different class time for each days. Other than that, everything is perfect. I don't think the app needs improvement for the design or fonts.

My 9yo is very visual so we needed a block schedule AND a list schdule. I love how we can add single events and get rid of single blocks when needed. The only requests I would have is if there could also be a bi-weekly option, an Only Edit This option, and a select multiple events to cancel (or even a full day cancel.) Maybe even smaller words on the blocks so we could see them! But we LOVE it !‚ò∫","5 people found this review helpful","Show review history","Swazer","July 23, 2022","Thank you for your feedback.
