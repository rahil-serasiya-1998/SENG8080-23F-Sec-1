I'm using it to manage my own personal projects and to do lists, but from what I've seen it could also be useful in a professional setting. really like the list widget, it is easy to refresh and tick of items without having to actually open the app.","12 people found this review helpful","","","",""

The interface is a little quirky though. I feel that it could be a bit more intuitive. Perhaps it will get more streamlined with familiarity.","2 people found this review helpful","","Quire team","May 27, 2021","Hi! Thank you for your review!

And so much more than that! It has Kanban support and features so many handy tools for project management. Hopefully the company behind it can maintain independent as long as possible. The only downside is the restricted offline usage. You can only access the last opened project. Full offline support is a must have from my perspective. Please add for 5 stars @QuireTeam.","14 people found this review helpful","Show review history","","",""
