I didn't delete any of those. It's happened twice now, and the resplash folder is the only one from where the photos disappear. I think I had 50 or so pictures the last time I checked, I'm only left with about half of that number now? Not sure if there's something wrong with the app, but it doesn't happen to any of the other media on my phone.

The button is present in the auto wallpaper menu but it's tedious to open the app and go to the auto wallpaper menu to change the wallpaper every time. Edit: Thanks for the reply. Quick settings tile works fine for me. üëç","10 people found this review helpful","Brandon Lam","August 19, 2019","Hi Abishek, glad to hear that you are liking the app. Currently there is a quick settings tile that can be added to your notification drawer that will skip the current wallpaper.

Original: Auto wallpaper sets more frequently than the user specified interval, and the search terms are searching every word individually even without a comma separator. Other than that I'm loving the md2 redesign and the auto wallpaper feature. I'm definitely using the app a lot more now.","13 people found this review helpful","Brandon Lam","July 3, 2020","Hi Aaron, auto wallpaper is affected by Android Doze which tries to optimize background tasks to save battery. You can try and disable battery optimizations for Resplash if you want it to change closer to the specified interval. Also search terms without commas might just be working coincidentally depending on the terms. I hope that helps.","Show review history"

The wallpapers have very sharp resolution and great quality. The daily wallpaper feature is great, except that the app starts the 24 (or 48, and other options) hour count from the time you enable the feature. In other words, you do not get to choose when during the day you want the wallpaper to be replaced. If you enabled the feature at three o'clock in the afternoon, it will automatically replace your wallpaper everyday at three o'clock.","19 people found this review helpful","","","",""

A few suggestions. Please add an option where the user can add the collection or an artist as the source of the wallpapers. Also for the launchers like Pixel launchers, if there are more than 1 page on the home screen then, the wallpaper is not centered for the home page. For this, please add an option for horizontal wallpaper fix so that the wallpapers are always centered.","11 people found this review helpful","","","",""

I was looking for a customizable app that would let me use keywords or custom categories to change my Pixel 3's wallpaper every hour or so and this does exactly that. The navigation makes sense and is highly easy to use.","","","","",""
