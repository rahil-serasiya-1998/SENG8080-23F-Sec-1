Works when the screen's on(regardless of whether this app's open/in the foreground), but silent otherwise - just a silent notification. App settings and phone settings both perfectly correct - battery optimisation disabled; each kind of notification individually enabled and alerting with sound in phone settings. No permissions requested anyway.","6 people found this review helpful","","","",""

In my opinion it should have at least sound and vibration to be considered a complete app. Reply to developer's response: No bugs. I mistakenly assumed there is no sound because I didn't see sound options in the settings menu. Good app nonetheless!","28 people found this review helpful","Show review history","Mlem","November 16, 2021","Thank you for your feedback. When a timer completes there should be a sound and vibration - if that's not the case then there is a bug."

It's a notification sound I've never even heard on my device, that I can only assume comes with the app.","2 people found this review helpful","Show review history","Mlem","October 30, 2021","Thank you for your feedback.

I recommend that you should say in the app description how to skip timers, or add a mini tutorial. That way it would be a lot easier to know how to use it efficiently.","6 people found this review helpful","Show review history","Mlem","August 24, 2021","Thank you for taking the time to give us valuable feedback.

I wanna take this moment to thank the developers and congratulate them on the good job. The app is simple and easy to use. Although, I'd love if the app gives us a chance to edit the number of sets (25 min+5 min sets) to match the time we need. For example, if I want to work for 3 hours, I can set 6 sets of pomodoro cycles and so on. That's the only criticism I have but apart from that, amazing app. Thank you Devs. Keep up the good work!","4 people found this review helpful","Show review history","Mlem","October 20, 2021","Thank you for your kind words!
