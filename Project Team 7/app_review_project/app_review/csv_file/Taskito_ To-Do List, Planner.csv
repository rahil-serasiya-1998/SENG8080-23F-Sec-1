The only problem I have ever faced with this app is it doesn't notify for past events/tasks of the day when the device is switched on after the reminder time. For example, if the reminder time was 9 am and I switch on device as 9:05 am, I would miss the 9 am task. My older app used to do that and it was very convenient. You would be a 5 star app if you could also do that.","7 people found this review helpful","","",""

UI can and needs to be improved; ""Boards"" feature is not that useful, perhaps, a kanban-view feature can make it better. I like the overall app design, reminds me of my bullet journals. Months ago I send a few complaints and recommedation (from another id) and I do not see any of those changes and fixes being made.

I tried nearly every other popular option available on Play Store—and nearly every one of them misses some crucial feature or is locked behind a subscription wall. I bought the Premium version and it's a great relief to not have to deal with recurring subscription fees. I bought the product and I own it—I feel more in control and that's the point of a task app. However, PLEASE add a ""task duration"" feature (to specify a time period allotted to a task).","42 people found this review helpful","Taskito","May 6, 2021","Thank you for providing your valuable feedback.

I've had many organizing apps but this one stood out the most. Its format is clear and user-friendly. Its not complicated at all. What I like more about this is that all tasks get sorted automatically according to the time set, and that inner checklists are provided. However, I would've given it a five star if it also had an automatic reminder setting, instead of the user manually setting up reminders.

It's pretty; the colors, the timeline mode, the themes. Nice to have a good widget. Used the app for last 2 days and found that creating a task with a reminder takes a lot of clicks since time-date and repeating it are in different option. Snooze is limited for 4 hours, can't snooze it for a day or change the date from the pop-up window. It isn't cross-platform yet. There is only one widget. TickTick's free version does all this and some more.","2 people found this review helpful","Taskito","October 24, 2020","Thanks for your feedback.

The only thing missing is some kind of natural language processing to understand dates and times instead of making me pick in a date picker.
