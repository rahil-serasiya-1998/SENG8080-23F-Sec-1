It has pretty much everything you need for task management, scheduling, notetaking, etc. I'm genuinely impressed by how much this app has helped me to schedule and get my stuff organised. I would've given it a 5* if it wasn't for the slow UI of the mobile app.","6 people found this review helpful"

But it's Android version is too poor. Not the UI but the speed with which it works. No it's not the problem with the device or network. The loading sign keeps rotating and after a long time, the actual thing comes up. But I must appreciate the quality of desktop version. It's awesome although it lacks few features for perfect productivity system. Feature I wish for is ability to control checkbox like for creating recurring tasks","148 people found this review helpful"

On mobile it just keeps changing the formating from desktop format (specifically if there are 2 columns side by side) to stacking the columns one above another. And if it did that once that would be fine. But it keeps doing it every 3-5 minutes sometimes in the middle of typing. And then there is the regular margin glitch. On mobile it shows a margin to the edge or screen. But when you start typing the margin lowers down almost to edge of the screen.","84 people found this review helpful"

So while this can be a good organizer app, it's not something I'd rely on to quickly take notes. Also its slower on the mobile compared to a computer, and took me around 15 seconds for the app to open on my Pixel 3! So best to not completely close the app and keep it available on toggle mode.","5 people found this review helpful"

You can also format the table, the way you want. I love using it in my Mac. The iPhone version is also good.

I'm paying for the premium version of this program on my PC and would expect a working app too.
