Giving 3 stars because some tasks from my workspace doesn't appear in the ""my tasks"" bar even though the due date and time are set correctly. This made me miss out on certain tasks a few times! Also the extension on chrome isn't working at all. It worked the first few times but now I'm not able to directly add links to my list. Please fox this bug :)","15 people found this review helpful"

Brilliant for engineering students. You might find it difficult to start with in the beginning but gradually with time you'll find out how much powerful the app is and how easy it becomes to use.","4 people found this review helpful"

I was planning to create a Second Brain in Taskade so I installed this app but the app was...not good. It comes nowhere near the web version. I really wish the app starts to look something like that with all those amazing features, especially those different views (mindmaps, calendar etc). The app also lags on my Samsung tablet.","11 people found this review helpful"

Plus everything is cloud synchronized, that means all your plans, schedules, can be viewed on multiple devices, and moreover on the web version, you can view your lists as mind map, organization chart, and much more. Even the taskade mobile is getting good updates frequently. And they have lots of free useful templates for us to use. Taskade never disappointed me. THANKS A LOT.","35 people found this review helpful"

The different views are really helpful. I think the UI/UX could be cleaner. Not every project needs to have the chat or call options and few other things like that.

I was looking to have an app that does cross sync between Windows OS and Android OS. But only concern is that it is not opening offline. Also it needs WIFI connectivity in Mobile.. Otherwise it is not opening in Mobile Data connection.. And it would be good if they provide Widget option in Desktop version.. Other than that the App is awesome.. But currently I uninstalled it and using my favourite app TickTick..","9 people found this review helpful"

Only problem is it lags a lot. I don't know if it's cause of my phone or anything, but it hangs a lot so I can't edit tasks quickly (often times,random selects happen, intentional selects are VERY slow and causes a lot of trouble) Ps. I think an option for selecting a lot of tasks for deleting and reordering should be made. Other than that, this app is the best app for organising,overall.","15 people found this review helpful"

It's more complete than most other apps and it doesn't have annoying limits. It's incredibly flexible and functional, perfect for people who have multiple projects with different structures. If one day my projects and team grow enough to use the paid features, I'll keep using this app and pay for the extra features because they were free when I was small.","2 people found this review helpful"

The features don't work at all: can't modify, can't change type (bullet, task, paragraph), lags, freezes, doesn't save properly, when I want to edit a text a blank page appears, even though the editing options appear I can't see my text (I'm not sure how to explain this last issue). I prefer the pc/desktop and online version. Big downside is that you MUST HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION to open and use taskade on the phone. Can't you ""pre-save"" like Notion does?","2 people found this review helpful"

I am really impressed how responsive Taskade's support is. Usually when one sends an email to a help center, it ends up in a black hole with no reply, but when I contacted Taskade's support, I got a reply within 24h. They had been sending me emails with upadates until the issue was solved.","3 people found this review helpful"

Very easy to add tags, export data when needed, and upload related files for projects.

This Bounty of Resources within one app allows for the possibility to integrate 'AI Content Creation' in the form of Publishable Content, images, audio, video, and presentation. It's so close you could almost see it if pictures, videos, and such were resizable and presentational as in PowerPoint for example. I'll submit these suggestions to John. Thanks, Jim Manley",""

I'm currently in the process of switching from todoist to taskade but I'm encountering a serious problem. That is, whenever I click on the Quick Add Widget, I'm taken to the Taskade app but the keyboard doesn't open up. So I'm unable to use this crucial function to capture my thoughts on time. Can you please check and make it working in the next update? My phone is realme 3, running Android v.10. I use a launcher called Niagra Launcher.

Very fast to learn as you go and the ability to share my lists, the flexibility to have other things that aren't checklists... Why is no one talking about this app? The compatibility!!!! Desktop + Android + IOs? Highly recommend. Am currently using it to plan my wedding, out-of-state move, and college requirement. It is perfect for big projects, brainstorming, note-taking, and organizing, and there are different ways to view your project to visualize it better. 5*","3 people found this review helpful"

It's an all in one productivity, project management, task management, & team collaboration tool. The mobile app is great for checking on projects & responding to stuff on the go, but it only shows list view, so not ideal if you're doing mobile only todo lists - and not ideal for creating projects/templates. It has replaced trello, asana, notion, and whatsapp for our remote team. The devs are really responsive to feedback and support community input.",""

This is pretty much a one tool to rule them all. Some UX shall be improved, and UI can get a new coat of paint.
