Everything is pretty fast and neat. There's no need of refreshing it. The messages are sent and received in real-time. Loving it. However, there's a shortcoming for which, my rating fir this app is stuck at 4: there's no way to customise font! Basic underline, italic, bold, font resize, colour, etc. are missing. With inclusion of these customisation, this app would be the best in mobile work-emailing.","211 people found this review helpful","Spike Email - Your Inbox reinvented","January 23, 2022","Hi Amit,

Using this for last few days and working great. Only issue that I faced and development team should aware of , the cloud attached for Google drive is not working well.

The major problem with an email discipline is consistency. I think this app enforces that through auto archive on reply. Just install it once. My only caveat is inability to add my profile picture for some reason. It doesnt load my gallery nor ask for permission which it already has. Anyway, this will work as you want. Even you think you are going to stick to your way, spike works the way you want it to. So install it now.","117 people found this review helpful","","",""

All thumbs up for the awesome work..in the beginning, but the latest version has managed to earn the app a 4 star downgrade. Reason: Following the phone clean up, the app freezes on intro screen and goes into an endless loop. No matter how many log in reiterations I go through, the result is always the same. Don't exactly know what the dev.s did here, but they sure didn't develop anything further.

OG: Really visually appealing and efficient to use! My only problem is that messages with pics often won't send. I'm not sure if it might just be because I'm using cell data which is a little slower than what the app needs? Just wish that the message would send slowly but still send, rather than saying ""can't send"" so quickly.

Limiting the search history's scope was frustrating, but not too bad. Now the amount of accounts you can link has been limited meaning the whole point of the app for me is now hidden behind a subscription fee. Sadly I can't justify paying for an email apps subscription fee on my current budget so I guess it's time for me to move on to another app.","116 people found this review helpful","Spike Email - Your Inbox reinvented","September 23, 2022","Hey Rhyme, In order to see full search history, and add more than 1 account, you‚Äôll need to upgrade your account.

This is a huge turn off out if the gate. I bet this is killing your stickiness. Concept is great and so is dark theme. Sriousoy though, please auto-archive me already archived emails when I initialize my account. Every time I come back and give a try its hours of waiting for old. Emails to flood my inbox. At least bulk archive is easier now.","14 people found this review helpful","Spike Email - Your Inbox reinvented","November 16, 2022","Hello Mitch, Spike email app has improved productivity and communications for thousands of teams.

I really wanted to like this app, but as I load the one account which happens to be outlook. It won't populate messages unless the app is open on screen! It does not appear to support active sync or realtime message notification, it never makes any sound when it does decide to display a message. The best thing about it is pretty. Which gets zero points on my book.i tried messaging support perhaps there are settings I missed. They choose to say nothing.","2 people found this review helpful","Spike Email - Your Inbox reinvented","October 13, 2022","Hi Harry, it sounds like you are experiencing some connection issues with your email account that you've connected to Spike.

You can only search back 60 days in your emails if you're on a free account. It works but it's just something to look out for","7 people found this review helpful","Spike Email - Your Inbox reinvented","August 3, 2022","Hey Julien, to see the full search history, you‚Äôll need to upgrade your account.

I turned off all battery optimizations and enabled all background activity and it still doesn't notify when it should. Usually I have to open the app to check and then I'll see emails show up on the inbox homepage from like twenty minutes ago. Plus some emails don't fit in the page correctly and you can't zoom in or zoom out to see the whole email... Too many issues to trust, too bad because it's design is good","29 people found this review helpful","Spike Email - Your Inbox reinvented","July 14, 2022","Hey Chaz, thanks for the review.
