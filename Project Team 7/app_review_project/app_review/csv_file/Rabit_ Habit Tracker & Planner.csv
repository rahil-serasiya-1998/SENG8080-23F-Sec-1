Previously there was a bug which set streaks to zero if a habit was paused or a new habit was introduced. The recent update set many of my streaks to zero even if they were not scheduled for that day. I really liked this app. It has a lot of potential and plenty of features in the free version. It is intuitive and easy to use. But so many bugs makes me want to move away from this app.","87 people found this review helpful"

Each time I check of a task there is no sound which is really unpleasant. I know this sounds(pun not intended) very picky but it makes a huge difference to the experience and I didn't expect such a gamified habit tracking app to get this wrong. Very disappointed","86 people found this review helpful"

The premium is expensive and confusing. this app does not need monthly subscription, as the content does not keep refreshing (like Netflix).. it's a one time premium pay app which ideally allows access to more features. if they change the pricing model, I will definitely switch to premium.","67 people found this review helpful"

It's annoying Also, there should be an option for 'not to do' habits, it's not can be seen in most of the apps, although I like the UI but developer need to fix all bugs and should come up with new updates and features more frequently. 2 stars just because I like UI.","57 people found this review helpful"

Literally every single feature I've ever wanted. And the app itself looks pretty. But the best part is that the price is reasonable. Edit: the paid version upgrades the app into something else completely. I've never seen so much upgrade in premium. Please add options to set routine once a month or give options to perform on one day even if I set 2-3 days. E.g. If I backup on Saturday I don't get reminder on Sunday even if I set it on sat-sun","35 people found this review helpful"

It displays a message that you need a plus plan, even though you already have it. - when timer is on, the application makes sound every one second snd vibrates every ten seconds. No option to turn this off - there is no option to select a sound for the notifications when due date is reached, so it rings with default alarm sound.

It's extremely demotivating when you have worked at a habit consistently for weeks and one day of missing your habit and the plant is dead. It's not encouraging, it makes you feel like you should give up and all the work you have done thus far is meaningless. I would recommend that the plant deteriotes over time as you miss more days.","56 people found this review helpful"

This app is downright adorable, and the little plants are so much fun! I do have a couple of issues though. My main frustration is that I can't find a way to mark a habit as partially done. For example, if I set a habit to drink a glass of water 10 times a day, I can't swipe it left to track one of the ten without the card disappearing completely. I have a terrible memory so I won't be able to remember which glass I'm on, and making 10 seperate habits for water looks messy. 😟","222 people found this review helpful"

Two things that would make it much more useful: being able to view the actual number of times you did a habit in the overview/stats chart, and being able to rearrange the order of the habits. For example, my habit for going to bed shows up before my habit for brushing my teeth before bed. This makes it kind of annoying to read the list. I realize that's a nitpicky thing, but it would improve the experience.","214 people found this review helpful"

The UI looks nice enough and tasks seem well designed as types, like the ones with timers. But I haven't yet understood the purpose of the plants. There appears to be no way to interact with the plants except seeing they exist. The Todo list, which there are many free apps that you could use instead, is included in what looks like a ridiculously expensive subscription model. And I've run into bugs already with some UI elements.","13 people found this review helpful"

For example, I'd like to work out for 5 out of 7 days every week but it's not always on the same days. Also if I'd like to read at least 5 hours per week, and I do 2 hours one day and 3 hours the next, it shouldn't appear that I've skipped the next 5 days when I've actually made my weekly goal. An excel download option would be awesome and also the ability to view the whole habits chart at once. Otherwise, I love the design!","53 people found this review helpful"

But the app has lagging issues and feels overall slow and the experience isn't smooth at all. It doesn't have any widgets too, which is unfortunate for such app. I think it can also use some sound effects to make the experience of using smoother. It's also a little hard to navigate.

However, a lot is based on subscription to the premium version, so it loses its fun. I wish that the consequences of missing a few days of habits weren't so disastrous. The last thing I need is to be in a depressive episode, barely able to get out of bed, only to find that all my hard work getting plants is down the drain. Progress is not linear, and therefore missing days should not kill plants, just limit their growth temporarily!","28 people found this review helpful"

Now for some stupid reason they reversed the way you swipe to check things off. Even once I got used to that, I have several habits that I do multiple times per day and it's so hard to just mark one instance complete. It used to be that I'd swipe once for each time I completed the task. Super simple. Now I have to swipe then press the tiny 1 button. If I swipe too far, it'll automatically say I completed all instances instead of just one","4 people found this review helpful"

For instance it doesn't tell you how to mark a habit as complete, you just have to kinda guess or look at other reviews (swipe left if your searching for the answer). I think it would be a good idea to have the instructions at least pop up after you've made your first habit. The only other thing that I think needs improvement is adding a widget so you dont have to go in app to see what you need to do.","114 people found this review helpful"

Everything is very soft and neat, which I love. It's been helpful keeping me on track. I'm frustrated with signing in through a Google account being the only option. The second thing I don't like is the premium content. Some new plants being unlocked would make sense. Watching ads for coins to unlock objects seems like a thing you're stuck doing when the app is free. Even if a few were premium unlocks and the rest ads, that would be an improvement.","26 people found this review helpful"

It would be even better if I could connect with other users, or have a shareable page for instagram/Facebook stories to help share and find accountability.

The one thing that's kind of buggy is when you pause a habit (which is a great feature) if you only pause it for like a day or two, when you unpause it, it goes back to the day before and makes you say whether you did it or not, even though that's the day you had it paused. So you have to either lie and say you did it or let the streak end, which is unfortunate.","15 people found this review helpful"
