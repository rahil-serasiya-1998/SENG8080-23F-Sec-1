Signed up with a new email and the app since has been very buggy, lagging and glitchy, makes me loose patience. Tried the uninstall and reinstall but don't fix anything and problem still persists. Some updates do not show up on the screen and I have to wait for a few minutes before anything happens on the screen. Assumed it was a phone issue but it isn't. Please fix it. It's really annoying.","1 person found this review helpful","November 16, 2022","Hello, Srushti.

I've been following my set morning routine since the last 10 days without any issues, and the gentle nudging this app provides is extremely helpful. Would love it if there were an option to ""skip"" a routine for a day or two, so that it doesn't affect stats (eg. When I've taken a leave from work for a day and don't need to follow that routine).","51 people found this review helpful","September 14, 2020","Hello, Parijat Mishra

You can set up two routines with the free account and more with premium. You can customise the habits and icons and the timer end sound. I haven't used the behavioural environment and feedback features, so cannot comment on those.

I could never stick to a routine before, without hating it (or being extremely inconsistent with it). It would be really nice if there was a way to automatically play music from my music player app once I begin my Morning routine. Another feature I'd love is - if there's a way to temporarily shuffle my routine habits- (while I'm running a routine) [like somedays, I just want to have my breakfast- before exercising & meditating]. Right now, the only way to do that is keep hitting skip (& restarting the routine, for skipped habits). A simple dragging option would be nice","25 people found this review helpful","August 1, 2021","Hello, Pasta-san.

Feedback for Devs: I enjoy having my phone go into ""do not disturb"" (DnD) automatically in evenings, which turns off my ""system sounds"" (and I can only set an exception for ""Media"" sounds during DnD mode). Routinery sounds are considered ""system sounds"" by my phone, rather than ""media."" Therefore, I hear nothing when a routine item has ended for any of my routines during DnD hours.

It's very simple to use, with none of the distractions other routine apps have. It's always very kind, for lack of a better word, and doesn't penalize you for breaking a streak or exceeding your time limit - I know some ppl like that but I sure don't! I also asked the dev for support several months ago and they were very quick to assist me. Great app, worth the money!","39 people found this review helpful","August 15, 2022","Hello, Ariel Nepsky!

Even after diagnosis & meds, I still need them. This app has been hands down the BEST. Absolutely worth the money. I suspect the developers also have ADHD bc it's like they UNDERSTAND exactly what components are missing in those other apps. This app has almost EVERYTHING I need, is SO customizable, adorable, SO HELPFUL in helping me to MANAGE AN ADULT LIFE!! & Their team is SO responsive & compassionate. And they continue to IMPROVE it!","","November 8, 2022","Hello, Wonnie K..

Routines are required for me to stay functional and maintain consistency. I like Routinery and I'll be subscribing fully soon. It's simple to use, I love the UI, and so far, it helps me stay motivated since I am easily prone to abandon routines due to my aforementioned ADHD. I wish you could get more than one routine in the free version, which would make it a little more accessible, but still, $3.99 a month isn't a bad price for what you get. I approve! :)","25 people found this review helpful","August 11, 2022","Hello, Zaiyda B.

My tip would be, start with a routine you already do and slowly build. Don't just use one of the pre-build ones if it doesn't fit your needs.","","November 16, 2022","Hello, Amanda Francis.

I have adhd and it really keeps me on track. I'd buy the premium if I had the money, which is reasonable....I think $22-$27 for the year.","","November 1, 2022","Hello, Angela Holtz (Angie).
