However, I do miss a few features. 1) Would really like to pause a pomodoro in between without losing progress. 2) The alarm sound is too short and I would like it to repeat a few times 3) The option to edit the pomo while it is on. Otherwise I would recommend this app as it is very easy to use and has good UI.","142 people found this review helpful",""

Definitely worth trying out. The colours are pretty and the interface is simple, easy to follow. If you're in a hurry and you need to get work done without losing your peace of mind I'd definitely recommend this. And it's got interesting little quirks. P.S. For all the workaholics out there...you can skip the breaks. (hip hip hurray)","90 people found this review helpful",""

The moment I change it and go back to see the change, the 'cuckoo' option will be the one set. So is the case with the volume. And one thing that I would like to add is the deficit of a clock. A clock with the current colour scheme would just throw every other app out of competition","66 people found this review helpful",""

My only complaint is that for the distribution graph &total time the break time is also included in the data. It would be much better if it only has the Focus time. Including the break time in the total time makes no sense. Thats the only major flaw, it'd great if this can be corrected //The time distribution's bothering me alot Stopped using nowüòê","109 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

But I am giving it a four star because there are a few things that should be included . 1. While doing a pomodoro there's no option to PAUSE it. Instead the pomodoro will cancel and go back to the beginning. But I suggest you allow us to pause it. 2. There should be an option for the users to choose their own aesthetic and backgrounds. Rest is awesome and I finally found a good pomodoro app that is hassle free and easy to use.","136 people found this review helpful",""

Cant go beyond 60 mins. Cant maintain or export logs of how much we used it productively. Cant have it to full-screen to hide status bar and navigation bar (consider using empty space and increase time font size). Sounds are very limited. Good but below average. What this app does can be done by my clock app through stopwatch. Animation is not needed much. Cant stop if paused as it doesn't consider one time activity, wants to use it continuously & not leave.","24 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

It's reasonably simplistic with mostly resembling a ""one button"" approach. The design is also quite pleasant. I like it overall. There are some issues with timer not ringing sometimes, probably due to battery optimization, but kudos to developers for providing an in-app instructions about this issue and how it can be solved. I am still not sure how reliable the solution is so far, but I keep watching.","6 people found this review helpful",""

When a pomo is on pause, the app keeps tracking its time in statistics. For example, if I've paused a 25-min pomo for 5 minutes, in statistics, it'll show as 30 minutes. 2. In statistics' ""History"" section, there's no way to distinguish between different pomos ‚Äî they're all the same color. 3. In statistics, there's no way to see the number of pomos done, only the total time.","19 people found this review helpful",""

Those are the same things that you'd pay 4 in other apps. But i don't like that u put the brakes as a part of the pomodoro. I see that u put a graph to show focus and break in different colors but i think that (today) should be broken to 2 pieces 1-break 2-focus.i see the pomodoro as the number of hours I've studied and i don't want to see the breaks being a part of it because it's not studying.","2 people found this review helpful",""

If you can add to features, that'll take it to another level in my opinion. 1) When the time is up on the focused or relaxed modes, have the screen light up. I usually lock and close my phone so it doesn't distract me, but then I miss when I need to stop cuz the screen doesn't light up. 2) The ability to change sound profiles when in focused or relaxed mode.

But there are 2 things, the data can be more specific (hours instead of %) and In the graph, the name of the pomos should be shown. It would also be helpful if we were allowed to switch between pomos and had an overall pomo count instead of individual. But it is a great app with lots of potential.

I will give 5 stars when they fix the bug I experience. I cannot turn off the cuckoo noise or change any of the alarm settings. Hitting apply and going back to settings show they dont change. Not very useful if you need to be in a public place. The sound also doesn't play in earphones, but in the phones speaker. This is due to the media type they play the sound as, not required, but it would be good to add this as a checkbox choice in the alarm settings too.","23 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Nice colour selection. Reason for 4 is lack of sound customisation. Also it would be good to allow to set the timer to 1 minute instead of 5 (good for testing, does not interfere with functionality). If sound customisation was addressed (ability to select different sounds, including from phone or from files, and a pomodoro like sound), it would probably be one the best out there.","21 people found this review helpful",""
