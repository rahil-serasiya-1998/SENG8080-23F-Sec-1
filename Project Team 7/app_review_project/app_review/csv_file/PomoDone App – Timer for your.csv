This is the only app that syncs flawlessly with multiple services like Microsoft To Do, Google etc. It is the best app for task-based pomodoro sessions and those productivity boosters! I wish they worked on making it more intuitive in design and animations (e.g., see the scheme of Engross app). Overall, a great app that does what it says on the label.","2 people found this review helpful","Atgalaikas UAB","May 20, 2022","Thanks a lot for your review, Shri!

Additionally, I like the level of compatibility it offers across browser plug-ins, operating systems, via web page, and across different device types.

The PomoDone app model is to integrate into your preferred ToDo app rather than try to replicate the same functionality. This strikes me as exactly right - no pomodoro app can approach the ease and functionality of a good todo app, and PomoDone integrates with almost all of them. It does so flawlessly, is cross-platform and syncs in real time. (The pomodoro that shows up on my webapp is ticking away at exactly the same spot on my phone. Fantastic.) A lot of the reviews note the crappy UI and - in this - I kinda' agree. It is not beautiful. However, when you put this in context - Windows app, web app and integrations that are all slick and feature rich - PomoDone has ""pomodone"" a pretty fantastic job.","10 people found this review helpful","Atgalaikas UAB","January 18, 2020","Thank you very much for your 5-star review!

If you are using ToDoist than Pomodone seems like it was built purely to enable your productivity goals in ToDoist! Together, these apps are unbeatable! If you need to plan, schedule or prioritise your time, then you must by all means try using Pomodone along with ToDoist for an unbeatable, smooth and integrated solution! Though I do not use Pomodone by itself, it would indeed be a very good and effective time tracking solution, though there are others paid apps that are likewise good. THE BEST features I find to be the genius way that the app ties in to ToDoist, Trello and other such apps, (syncing all of your lists, schedules and priorities), and also the way that you must choose the amount of time, (5m, 10m, 15m, 25m, etc) rather than having a continual standard of timer minutes running.

The WebApp does implement this feature set pretty well, even though there are some major pain points - e.g. adding Log entries manually is very cumbersome and the integration with some services is buggy. Sadly enough the Android App is quite terrible (compared to the WebApp), and I ended up using the WebApp on the phone despite it not integrating into the underlying OS very well: 1. The Android App does not implement sleep / power saving properly and requires exceptions from the Android Battery Management System. But if the exception is granted the battery is drained dramatically by the app, so much that the phone runs very hot in my pocket 2. The Project/Task view is unusable - everytime a project is folded and unfolded again all tasks in the project are added to the list of tasks again. This means the list keeps growing and growing and this is persisted beyoned a app restart. The only fix is to clear the app cache and let it re-download the tasks from the connected task management tools (Asana in this case) 3. No configuration of Timer Alarm (e.g. use vibration only) 4. Cannot turn off screen to run in background because the alarms work inconsitently. Even if the app is listed as a priority app in the Do-not-Disturb exception list, the timer alarms don't get through","18 people found this review helpful","","",""

You can turn off the constant ticking sound (there are 2 settings for the timer, one is looped and one just to notify you about the timer start). The same for a break. It's customizable. 
Vibration and notification work if your device allows it + if the app is not visible at the moment (e.g. in the background)."

Also check it out how your app works in split screen mode. Make numbers and text smaller or put start and stop buttons in visible part of split screen.","","Atgalaikas UAB","July 22, 2019","Hi,

I want to view my active timer outside of the PomoDone App, and on my Wear OS watch. Is this on the roadmap?","1 person found this review helpful","Atgalaikas UAB","January 31, 2019","Hi Ennis, 
Can I ask, did you turn on Timer Sync in Profile Settings: 
https://my.pomodoneapp.com/profile/settings/#sync
If it's on, you'll be able to see the current timer on all of your PomoDone App instances (including Chrome ext), will be able to stop it and even receive the notifications, if your Android apps notification is turned on."

Why does a Pomodoro Timer require 50 mb? I loved the app but it's bloated characteristic made me switch to Engross.","1 person found this review helpful","Atgalaikas UAB","July 28, 2020","Thank you for your kind feedback. We are aware of this problem and are currently working on solving it.  Please update your app to the latest version when you see an option."
