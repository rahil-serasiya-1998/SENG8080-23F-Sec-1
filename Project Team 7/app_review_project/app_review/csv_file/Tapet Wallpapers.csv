I think they should add an option so that different users can upload their bests . So other users can easily pick nice wallpapers. Another thing is that some colors are irritating, I don't think that people should like them, but they are still there.","59 people found this review helpful","","",""

But my opinion is unchanged years later. It's invariably the first or second app I download whenever I replace my phone, and I find it hard to picture that ever changing. I also use the KISS launcher with the settings on ""beyond minimal"" (i.e. nothing, literally nothing at all, on the screen; which, as you can appreciate, makes a particularly focused examination zone in which a wallpaper app will pass or fail... Tapet passes.","18 people found this review helpful","","",""

So much. Huge kudos for the redesign and everything! It's so beautiful. That said while I will give it the 5 star rating it deserves just for the sheer artfulness of this app, I will state a few words more on the update: Unless it's not completely obvious here, there's no auto-save. Is there? Hard to say. Specific pattern repeats: this used to be a slide interval for each pattern, however this too has changed, and it's not clear if that's a feature still. That said I noticed that some patterns are history now, which many of them I did not quite like to begin with. I do like that you can drill down on each pattern and see variations, so that'll do. I must say the color picker is a little confusing. After you have set your specific colors and tell it you want ONLY those colors you've chosen, when you back out of that feature setting, it does revert to the default color picker screen and that does throw things off a bit. That said I've not seen my chosen color palettes stray on the patterns that have come up so I will leave it there. Lastly, this may be a device thing more than anything but the path to save generated patterns doesn't seem to stick, at least if you're trying to save it to a custom folder. I still however say that unless the auto-save feature is now default for the app, I would still miss the feature all the same as there's no setting for it at all. UPDATE: Beat me to it. Auto Save is back. Thank you much for bringing it back!","57 people found this review helpful","Adrian Aisemberg","March 21, 2022","Thank you so much for your support, Christopher!
